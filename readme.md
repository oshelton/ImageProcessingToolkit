# Image Processing Toolkit - Archived

**WARNING**: This code almost certainly does not compile; even if you took the time to update everything to a more recent version of Visual Studio. It is here as illustrative evidence that I do know some stuff about image processing, analysis, and C++.

This project was originally created to make experimentation easier for my projects in CSCI 8810 and CSCI 8820 at UGA (2011-2013). The program has since grown and serves as an experimental testbed for my image processing and computer vision research projects and is going to be a part of my thesis.

Unfortunately the more advanced version of the application that supported loading and saving graphs of nodes via [RapidXml](https://rapidxml.sourceforge.net/), [ITK](https://itk.org/) operation support, and Linux support has long since been lost and only this early version of the codebase survives.

A screenshot of this more advanced version does exist however:
